## AIM:
To write a C function to calculate the turnaround time of each process given their burst time and waiting time in First Come first Serve scheduling algorithm.
## Algorithm

1. Start with process, burst time, and waiting time arrays.
2. Loop through each process from i = 0 to n-1.
3. Compute tat[i] = burst_time[i] + wait_time[i].
4. End the algorithm.

## Program:

Program to find and display the priority of the operator in the given Postfix expression

```
int turnaroundtime( int proc[], int n,int burst_time[], int wait_time[], int tat[]) {

for ( i = 0; i < n ; i++)
tat[i] = burst_time[i] + wait_time[i]; return 0;
}
```
## Output:

## Result:
Thus, the C function to calculate the turnaround time of each process given their burst time and waiting time in First Come first Serve scheduling algorithm is implemented successfully.
